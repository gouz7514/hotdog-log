The project that went on for over 4 months is finished, and the intense one-month Woowa Tech Course is also over!
While thinking about what to study next, **I thought I'd dig deeper into React**, so I'm diligently studying by going back and forth between the [official documentation](https://react.dev/) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/best-react/).

Since the content I organized using Obsidian is convenient for me to see, I felt like I wanted to record it on my blog.
While thinking about how to record it, I happened to access velog and noticed that the service's speed wasn't as stable as before (there seem to be more minor bugs lately too..), so I decided to develop my previously built personal website into a blog for recording!

So starting with this post, I want to record the process of completing my personal blog.

This post is the first one, recording <span style="color:#ff69b4">**switching from styled-components to emotion**</span>.

ðŸ’¡ **Goal**
- Learn the differences between `emotion` and `styled-components`
- Switch to `emotion`

> **This post is written based on nextjs 13.2 version using page router.**

## Why Switch Styling Tools?
Previously, I had applied `styled-components` to my website.
While studying `nextjs`, I applied the easy-to-use `styled-components`, but as I worked on side projects, there were [various difficulties](https://velog.io/@gouz7514/how-to-use-nextjs-13-properly#styled-components), and I decided to switch to try new technology as well.

### Reason 1: `use-client`
As NextJS became based on server components, using `styled-components` forces the use of `use-client` at the top of files. This ultimately prevents you from utilizing the advantages of server components and makes it impossible to implement server-side operations like metadata as desired.

![styled components issue - use client](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/gouz7514/post/4778a135-5873-4acd-b0f9-4a183f5855e4/image.png)
In fact, [many developers are raising issues about this](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/4025).
Of course, this doesn't mean `styled-components` is a wrong tool at all. In fact, many more developers and companies are using `styled-components`. However, I reached the conclusion that I needed to change styling tools to quickly implement desired behaviors in the upgraded NextJS.

### Reason 2: Complex Setup
Using `styled-components` requires separate configuration:
- When using app router
Following the [official website's recommendation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components), you need to create a global registry component and import that file.

- When using page router
You need to add style sheets on the server side to the `_document.tsx` file. Additionally, you need to apply babel configuration to ensure styling works smoothly on the server side. (Need to confirm if this is mandatory)

(In contrast, `emotion` can be used just by installing it!)
For these reasons, I decided to switch to <span style="color:#ff69b4">**emotion**</span>!

## `emotion` vs `styled-components`
Since both tools are css-in-js libraries and use sass syntax, their usage methods are quite similar.

- `styled-components`
```javascript
const Title = styled.h1`
  font-size: 1.5em;
  text-align: center;
  color: palevioletred;
`
render(<Title>Hiya!</Title>)

// Object syntax
const button = styled.button({
  fontSize: '1.5em',
  textAlign: 'center',
  color: 'palevioletred'
});
```

- `@emotion/styled`: Package for component styling
```javascript
const Button = styled.button`
  padding: 32px;
  background-color: hotpink;
  font-size: 24px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  color: black;
  font-weight: bold;
  &:hover {
    color: white;
  }
`

render(<Button>Hey! It works.</Button>)
---
render(
  <h1
    className={css`
      font-size: 1.5em;
      text-align: center;
      color: palevioletred;
    `}
  >
    Hiya!
  </h1>
)

// Object syntax
const titleStyles = css({
  fontSize: '1.5em',
  textAlign: 'center',
  color: 'palevioletred'
})

render(<h1 className={titleStyles}>Hiya!</h1>)

```

Although I haven't used both tools proficiently, I summarized some differences by browsing through official documentation and various blogs:
- emotion allows debugging using TypeScript when writing CSS ([source](https://emotion.sh/docs/best-practices))
- Component styling syntax in emotion was influenced by styled-components
- emotion is lighter
- emotion's syntax is more developer-friendly ([source](https://emotion.sh/docs/composition))
- Speed is comparable

Ultimately, which tool to use seems to depend on developer preferences and coding convention differences.

## Switching to `emotion`
Now I just need to apply emotion to my personal blog!

### Applying Global Styles
Use `Global` provided by `@emotion/react` to apply global styles to the entire project.

You can apply reset CSS here if needed.
```typescript
// src/styles/GlobalStyle.tsx
import { Global, css } from '@emotion/react'

const style = css`
	...
	Global styles to apply to the project
`
const GlobalStyle = () => <Global styles={style} />

export default GlobalStyle
```

Then apply `GlobalStyle` to `_app.tsx`.
```typescript
// src/pages/_app.tsx
import GlobalStyle from '@/styles/GlobalStyle'

export default function App() {
	return (
    	<>
      		<Head>...</Head>
      		<Layout>
      			<GlobalStyle /> // Apply here
      			...
      		</Layout>
      	</>
    )
}
```

After that, just erase traces of `styled-components` one by one.

Looking at job postings, there are many companies using emotion (especially Toss..!), and it was a good opportunity while wanting to try new technology.

I was confused about what to study, but while creating a personal blog, let's continue studying react, nextjs, and even complete my resume and portfolio!
