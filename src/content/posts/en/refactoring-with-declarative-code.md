When developing web services, you end up using 'modals' more often than you'd think.

At ABJET where I currently work, we actively utilize various modals including service announcements and more.

As our service gradually became more sophisticated and we needed to develop various modals within short timeframes, I felt the necessity for componentization for reusability and writing intuitive code that anyone could understand.

In this post, I want to summarize how we previously implemented modal components and how we improved them.

### 1. Defining Modal Structure
Rather than writing code first when implementing modals, I wanted to break down modals into different sections and clarify the role of each section.

The above diagram is a rough illustration defining the common UI of modal components - UI that's commonly used in any modal.

Let's take a simple look:

- When a modal appears, a backdrop covers the existing screen and the modal is positioned at the center of the screen
- The modal is largely divided into 3 sections
- The `ModalTitle` area specifies the modal's title and role
- The `ModalBody` area contains the actual modal content
- The `ModalFooter` area is for action buttons

### 2. Implementing Modal Components
For implementing modal components, I referenced Channel Talk's open-source design system [bezier-react](https://github.com/channel-io/bezier-react).

Before diving into detailed explanations, here's a simple Anatomy of bezier-react's [Modal component](https://github.com/channel-io/bezier-react/blob/main/packages/bezier-react/src/components/Modal/Modal.tsx):

```javascript
// Component structure
<Modal>
  <ModalTrigger />
  <ModalContent>
    <ModalHeader />
    <ModalBody />
    <ModalFooter />
  </ModalContent>
</Modal>
```

I judged it similar to the modal we wanted to implement - the way modals are opened and closed through `trigger`, and how three areas `Header`, `Body`, and `Footer` come together to form one modal.

Based on this, the final implemented modal code is as follows:
```javascript
// Modal.tsx
// Handles the actual UI of the modal. ModalTitle, ModalBody, ModalFooter are included here.
function ModalContent() {
  const { style, onCloseModal, disableOutsideClick, footer } =
    useContext(ModalContext);
  const modalContentRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useOutsideClick(modalContentRef, () => {
    if (!disableOutsideClick && onCloseModal) onCloseModal();
  });

  return (
    <S.ModalWrapper ref={modalContentRef} style={style}>
      <ModalTitle />
      <ModalBody />
      {footer && <ModalFooter />}
    </S.ModalWrapper>
  );
}

/**
 * Modal component for covering the page and receiving user input or simple confirmation.
 * When children are passed as props, they are delivered to the ModalTrigger component.
 * When ModalTrigger is clicked, the modal is displayed and the modal content itself is rendered to the backdrop through a portal.
 *
 * Instead of using children, when using the Modal component externally, you can control the modal using `externalShow` and `onCloseModal`.
 *
 * When `type` is confirm, `title` is string. When `type` is close, title is string | React.ReactNode.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * // Modal structure
 * <Modal>
 *  <ModalTrigger />
 *  <ModalContent>
 *    <ModalTitle />
 *    <ModalBody />
 *    <ModalFooter />
 *  </ModalContent>
 * </Modal>
 * ```
 */
export function Modal(props: ModalProps) {
  const { children, onShow, onCloseModal, externalShow } = props;
  const [backdrop, setBackdrop] = useState<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);
  // state managing the modal's visibility
  const [show, setShow] = useState(externalShow || false);

  const onClickShowModal = () => {
    setShow(true);
  };

  const onClickCloseModal = () => {
    if (onCloseModal) onCloseModal();
    setShow(false);
  };

  // An element with backdrop id exists in _app.tsx
  useEffect(() => {
    setBackdrop(document.getElementById('backdrop') as HTMLDivElement);
  }, []);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (show && onShow) onShow();
  }, [show, onShow]);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (externalShow !== undefined) {
      setShow(externalShow);
    }
  }, [externalShow]);

  return (
    <>
      {children && (
        <ModalTrigger onClickShowModal={onClickShowModal}>
          {children}
        </ModalTrigger>
      )}
      {show && (
        <ModalContext.Provider
          value={{ ...props, onCloseModal: onClickCloseModal }}
        >
          {backdrop &&
            (createPortal(
              <Backdrop deep>
                <ModalContent />
              </Backdrop>,
              backdrop as HTMLDivElement
            ) as ReactNode)}
        </ModalContext.Provider>
      )}
    </>
  );
}
```

The component's anatomy and usage are not much different from the referenced bezier-react, but the code looks longer and more complex. This is because the modal functionality required by our service became more complex compared to when it was first implemented.

- Deciding whether to close the modal when clicking outside (`disableOutsideClick`)
- Controlling modal opening/closing without using a separate component (ModalTrigger) (`externalShow`: meaning to show the modal from outside the modal)

The actual modal component written based on the above code was as follows:
```javascript
<Modal
  type={MODAL_TYPES.CONFIRM} // UI of ModalTitle area changes based on type
  title={isEdit ? 'Edit Group' : 'Add Group'}
  titleAlign="left" // text-align direction of title
  externalShow={externalShow}
  onCloseModal={onCloseModal}
  content={ // actual modal content
    <StyledInput
      guide="Group Name"
      required
      clearable
      width={'100%'}
      value={productName}
      maxLength={20}
      onInput={handleOnInput}
      placeholder="Enter group name (max 20 characters)"
    />
  }
  footer={{ // modal footer area
    left: (
      <Button size="medium" fullWidth>
        Go Back
      </Button>
    ),
    right: (
      <Button
        size="medium"
        type="primary"
        onClick={onClickSave}
        fullWidth
        disabled={!productName}
      >
        Save
      </Button>
    ),
  }}
/>
```

Now it gradually became something that's hard to call a component - a modal component that would be difficult to understand without explanation from the creator... ðŸ˜¥

### 3. Refactoring with `useOverlay`
One day, while struggling with the modal component that had become a burden, a period came when feature sprints were somewhat completed and I could refactor the code.

There were many tasks that could be solved including infrastructure improvements and considerations for new projects, but I prioritized modal component refactoring first for the following reasons:

- Increased necessity for unified modal logic in gradual monorepo adoption
- Efficient code became essential for feature deployment in short periods

While thinking about how to solve the critical shortcomings of managing with state and props, I encountered [toss-slash's useOverlay](https://www.slash.page/ko/libraries/react/use-overlay/src/useOverlay.i18n).

***`useOverlay` is a utility for handling Overlay declaratively.***

I focused on the word "declarative" here. In programming, "declarative" is a concept that contrasts with "imperative". According to [React's official documentation](https://react.dev/learn/reacting-to-input-with-state#how-declarative-ui-compares-to-imperative), declarative programming means describing UI with each visual state rather than directly manipulating the UI. Going a step further, [Toss FE Chapter](https://toss.tech/article/frontend-declarative-code) considers declarative code as "code with a higher level of abstraction".

In other words, the modal component code I had written was code that was difficult to respond to diversification (code with a low level of abstraction) and was gradually becoming bad code.

Reminding myself of the mindset of "being uncomfortable with discomfort", I proceeded with refactoring all existing modal components using the `useOverlay` hook, and the key points to consider during this process were:

- Not trying to handle various modal UIs with one component (= raising the abstraction level)
- Creating a structure that allows quick development even when new modal UI development is needed

The modal code I implemented after thinking based on the above content is as follows:
```javascript
// components/common/Modal/Modal.tsx
import { forwardRef, useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';
import { Backdrop } from '../Backdrop';

import * as S from './styled';

export const Modal = forwardRef(function Modal<T>({
  open,
  children,
  width = 375,
}: {
  open: boolean;
  children: React.ReactElement<T>;
  width?: number;
}) {
  const [backdrop, setBackdrop] = useState<HTMLDivElement | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setBackdrop(document.getElementById('backdrop') as HTMLDivElement);
  }, []);

  return (
    <>
      {open &&
        backdrop &&
        createPortal(
          <Backdrop deep>
            <S.ModalWrapper style={{ width: width }}>{children}</S.ModalWrapper>
          </Backdrop>,
          backdrop as HTMLDivElement
        )}
    </>
  );
});
```

```javascript
// ex) Modal usage example - useSpecificModal
import { Modal } from '@/components/common';

export function useSpecificModal() {
  const overlay = useOverlay(); // Using Toss's useOverlay hook

  return useMemo(
    () => ({
      open: (id: number) =>
        overlay.open(({ isOpen, close }) => (
          <Modal open={isOpen} width={610}>
	          {/* Component that will be Modal's contents goes in as children */}
          </Modal>
        )),
      close: overlay.close,
    }),
    [overlay]
  );
}
```

First, I raised the abstraction level of the common UI for all modal components and defined it.
In other words, I defined a common `Modal` component that implements only backdrop and center alignment, not including division into three areas.

Next, I defined custom hooks with the `useOverlay` hook according to each modal's required situation to use each modal declaratively. When additional props need to be passed, I implemented it by passing the necessary props to the open method and receiving them in the `Modal` component.

So how did the code change compared to before refactoring?

```javascript
// AS_IS: Before refactoring, need to define show state for each modal, handle numerous props = verbose code ðŸ˜¥
const [showSpecificModal, setShowSpecificModal] = useState(false)
...
<SpecificModal
  show={showSpecificModal}
  // numerous other necessary props
/>

// TO_BE: After refactoring, code became much more concise and clear. Higher abstraction level = more React-like! ðŸ˜Š
const { open } = useSpecificModal()
```

Even though I didn't perform any technically tremendous work, I could confirm that the code's readability improved significantly and became code that anyone could understand. For writing new modals afterward, I was able to develop much faster than before using the `Modal` component and `useOverlay` hook.

---
## Conclusion
The currently refactored modal code is only being used in one repository, but going further, I'm at the stage of **reviewing the inclusion of modals and hooks in the design system** through close communication with designers and fellow FE developers.

Also, rather than stopping refactoring here, I plan to continue thinking about ways to write more concise code and separate common logic.

Through this refactoring, I was able to learn how to write more React-like code and how to write better code that goes beyond my existing code. Going forward, I want to continue solving various "discomforts" through consistent thinking.
